## Tree-based imputation approach

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: ee5a81dc7c
disable_transition: false
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
Idea: replace statistical models by decision trees to predict missing values
+ No assumptions on relationships
+ Can pick up complex nonlinear patterns
+ Therefore often better prediction performance
− Less variability as predictions are based only on observations in corresponding leaf
− Statistical methods predict from a conditional distribution (suitable for multiple imputation)
